#Project Overview
The Student Lifecycle Management System (SLMS) operates as the central hub for student-related processes within a university. It seamlessly integrates with existing systems, aligns with the institution's goals, and caters to diverse stakeholders, including the Dean of Students, admission offices, finance, faculty, and students. The SLMS ensures regulatory compliance, adapts to the institution's technological framework, and evolves to meet future needs. It optimizes collaboration, enhances data accuracy, and contributes to an efficient student management ecosystem.
